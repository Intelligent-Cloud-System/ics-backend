# ics-backend

### IDEA

The idea of the project is to create storage service which can be configured very fast.
Clients should be able to create create a user, give him permissions and get credential for this user(token, maybe something more in the future). They will do it on our website.
In the future it would be ideal to write a library which will simplify using our library.
